I've got all of the cells exposed, now I need to scan them, and dispose of any of them that are empty or damaged.

I can use the same for loop range as last time to loop through all of the cells, but the logic inside the loop will need to be a bit more complex.

I'll have to check for 2 things. First, I'll need to check if 'CellFullness(cellID)' < 10. Then I'll have to check if 'CellDamaged()'. If either condition is true I need to call 'Dispose(cellID)' to get rid of the cell. I can do this with two if statements inside of the for loop, or I can review the manual for how to use the 'or' keyword to combine both checks in one if statement.

~The system reported that I tried to dispose of a useful cell. It stopped the process to avoid fuel waste. I should review my if conditions to make sure I'm only disposing of cells with fullness < 10 or damaged cells.

~The program exited but system analysis still reports that there are damaged or empty cells somewhere in the system. I should make sure my for loop is covering the full 'range(1,987)' and that my if conditions are correct.
