Shields are almost fully operational. They're activating on time, but they're not reacting correctly to threats. The shields can be set to resonate on several different frequencies called 'colors'.

The shields are supposed to change color based on what kind of threat they're blocking, but they aren't reacting. That could cause trouble.

To fix it I'll need to replace the color switching logic. There are four things I'll need to check for in a specific order.

if threatEnergy > 10, color should be set to "blue"
elif threatSize > 5, color should be "green"
elif threatEnergy < 2, color should be "magenta"
else color should be "white"

~The shield still isn't reacting properly. I should either check the if conditions, or make sure that the cases are in the correct order.
