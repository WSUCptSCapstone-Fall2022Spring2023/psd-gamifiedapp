 Shields are now operating at full strength. The final step is to activate the port and starboard shields. 

This works a lot like the forward shielding, but due to power constraints I can only activate the left or right shields, and I'll need them to turn off when they aren't needed. 

I should be able to do this easily with an 'elif' statement. 'elif' is short for 'else if' and I should use it if I need to do one thing, or another thing based on a different condition.

For example...
if variable > 5:
	DoSomething()
elif variable < 3:
	DoSomethingElse()

I can even add multiple 'elif' cases in a row. The only rule is that it has to begin with an 'if' statement, and if I want to use an 'else' statement it has to come at the end.

To make the shields work I'll need to call 'Activate("left")' or 'Activate("right")' to activate the left or right shields. 

It's important that I remember to add quotes ("") around the words left or right when I pass them into the function. That makes the data into a 'string' which is a short piece of text.

I'll need to 'Activate("left")' or 'Activate("right")' when the respective 'Distance("left")' or 'Distance("right")' is low enough. 'else' I'll need to call 'Deactivate()' the shields to save power.

~Something struck the port-side hull. I need to make sure that one of my cases checks
'if Distance("left") < 20:"
and that I'm deactivating the shields with 'Deactivate()' when they aren't needed using an 'else:' case.

~Something struck the starboard hull. I need to make sure that one of my cases checks
'if Distance("right") < 20:"
and that I'm deactivating the shields with 'Deactivate()' when they aren't needed using an 'else:' case.
