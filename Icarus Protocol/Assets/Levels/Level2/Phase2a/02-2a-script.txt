Cycles are up 489%, great! It looks like the process is using up more power than it is supposed to, however.

It looks like something is missing in the power inversion script.

It's supposed to have a bit of logic here that makes the power switching faster. I'll have to replace it.

The intended logic is something like... 
"if switchingPower is True, set quantumStretch to 83. Else, set it to 49" followed by a seperate if else statement that reads...
"if shieldStrain > 50, then set outputPower to quantumStretch * 11, else set outputPower to quantumStretch * 3"

~Something went wrong. I should review the algorithm, and make sure that I'm setting both quantumStretch and outputPower to the correct values.

~The system reports an incorrect quantum stretch. I'm setting it, but either my if-else condition is wrong or I miswrote my math.

~The system reports an incorrect output power. I'm setting it, but either my if-else condition is wrong or I miswrote my math.
