Cycles are up 489%, great! It looks like the process is using up more power than it is supposed to, however.

It looks like something is missing in the power inversion script.

It's supposed to have a bit of logic here that makes the power switching faster. I'll have to replace it.

The intended logic is something like... 
"if switchingPower equals True, set quantumStretch = 83. Else, quantumStretch = 49" 
followed by a seperate if else statement that reads...
"if shieldStrain > 50, then set outputPower = quantumStretch * 11, else outputPower = quantumStretch * 3"
I'll just need to use the skills I have to translate this logic into code.

~Something went wrong. I should review the algorithm, and make sure that I'm setting both quantumStretch and outputPower to the correct values.

~The system reports an incorrect quantum stretch. I'm setting it, but either my if-else condition is wrong or I miswrote my math.

~The system reports an incorrect output power. I'm setting it, but either my if-else condition is wrong or I miswrote my math.
