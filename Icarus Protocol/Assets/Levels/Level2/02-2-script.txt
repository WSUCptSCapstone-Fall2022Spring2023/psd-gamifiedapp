The shields are activating on time to stop threats, but they still don't have enough power. I should be able to fix that by cycling the shield polarity.

To do this I'll need to check if the 'currentPolarity' is positive (greater than 0), and if so switch it to negative by calling 'SetNegative()'.

Otherwise I should set it to positive with 'SetPositive()', making it flip back and forth quickly. I can do this by applying an 'else' case. 

An else case looks something like...
'if variable == 3:
	DoSomething()
else:
	DoSomethingElse()'

I can review what an if/else statement looks like in the manual. To cycle the shields I'll need to write one that calls 'SetNegative()' when 'currentPolarity > 0' and 'else' it calls 'SetPositive()'

~It looks like I overloaded the shields generators! That means I called 'SetPositive()' when it was already positive or 'SetNegative()' when it was already negative.

~It appears that the shields aren't cycling fast enough. I should make sure that the shields are alternated back and forth every time the code is run.

~The shield generators locked up. That likely means I called the alternator functions too fast. I should only alternate one time at most each time my code is run.
