If I don't want the Helios exploding the first time we hit an asteroid field, I should get the forward shielding operational. The problem is that I'm running on emergency power. I need to make sure that I only use the shields 'if' they're needed.

I can do this using an 'if statement', also sometimes called a 'conditional'. For instance, this conditional;
	if variable < 5:
		DoSomething() 
means 'if variable is less than 5, then DoSomething()'. 

I start by writing 'if', and then the if condition, a True or False statement often using special operators like '==' to check if two bits of data are equivalent, or '>' or '<' for greater or less than. 
After the conditional, I must place a colon ":" to begin the if block.

On the following lines, I 'TAB' in one time, and write the code that should only run if the condition is true. All the conditional code has to be 'TAB'-ed in one step, and the if-block ends when I stop tabbing lines in.
(Ex.)
	if True:
		DoIfConditionIsTrue()
	DoNextRegardless()

So I need to set it up so that if 'threatDistance' is less than 25, the code calls 'ActivateShields()'. 
Call it too early and I'll run out of power. Call it too late and the ship will be damaged.
I can review what if statements look like in the manual.

~An example of the conditional I'll need looks something like 
	if threatDistance < 600:    
		ActivateShields()

~SyntaxError("unexpected token '<newline>'")
This error likely means that I forgot to end my conditional with a colon (:) before the indented block.

~SyntaxError('expected an indented block')
After my if statement line, all of the code "inside" the block on the following lines must be 'indented' to the right. I can use TABs or spaces, all that matters is that the inner block is indented to the right, and that my indentation is consistent.
