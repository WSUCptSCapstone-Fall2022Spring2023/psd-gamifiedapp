Most of the shields activated fine in the simulation, but some of them say their shielding program is corrupted.

This code is mostly correct, but some of the conditions are wrong.

It is supposed to check first that the shields are active. Then, if they are, it is supposed to check if 'powerSupply > 70' before sending out a ShieldPulse().
I need to figure out what's wrong with this code that's causing it not to work.

~It still isn't working. It looks like the ShieldPulse() is sometimes getting called when it shouldn't.

~It isn't quite right yet. Some of the tests which should trigger the shield aren't doing so.
