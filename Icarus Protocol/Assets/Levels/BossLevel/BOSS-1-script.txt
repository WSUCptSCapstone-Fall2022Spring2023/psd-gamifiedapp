... something is wrong.
ERROR: EXTERNAL AGENT DETECTED

CODE CORRUPTION DETECTED

MALICIOUS CODE DETECTED

What is going on? Someone else is in the system. They're making minor changes to the code that are disrupting existing systems. I'll need to correct them... quickly.

The system first detected an error somewhere in this code. 

It's intended to trigger space compression if the compression core is active. Space compression should loop until CompressionFactor() is at least 100. Most of this code is correct but a small error somewhere is stopping it from working. 

~It doesn't seem to be compressing enough space. I should check how many times the system loops the CompressSpace command.
