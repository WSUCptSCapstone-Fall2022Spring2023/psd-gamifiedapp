It looks like some of the data that the comms unit is reading is corrupted. I should check on its encoding.

Decryption protocol 8371555 appears to be the issue. I'll need to fix the decryption function to receive working data.

To decrypt data I'll first need to call 
	Receive()
while 
	Remaining() 
is greater than 0.

Once I've received all the data, I can use 'GetData()' to get the encrypted data value and store it in a variable of some kind.

So I need to receive data while there is data remaining, store GetData() in a variable (called something like encrypted), and finally decrypt it using this function.
	decrypted = encrypted + 2973 * 7119374 / 81738 % 1836 
I should assign my final value to the variable 'decrypted' to finish the function.

~It looks like I didn't process the data before trying to decrypt it. I won't be able to pull the correct data if I don't have the whole package.

~I pulled all the data, but I didn't decrypt the correct value, I'll need to make sure that I'm using the correct decryption function.
