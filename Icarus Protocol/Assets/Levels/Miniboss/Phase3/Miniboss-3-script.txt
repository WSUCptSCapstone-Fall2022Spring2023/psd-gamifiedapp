Whoever this is, I think I found the error in the antivirus program that's allowing them to make these changes. There are just a few more syntax errors in this corrupted code, but fixing them should put a stop to this.

~Something about the logic of the function got changed while I was fixing syntax errors. I need to fix the bugs, but not change anything else in the process.

~SyntaxError("unexpected token '='", (None, 5, 18, '\telif threatType = "logic bomb":\n'))
This error likely means I used a single '=' when I should be using a double equals '=='

~SyntaxError("can't assign to literal", (None, 8, 3, '\t\t694 = countermeasure'))
This error means that I tried to assign a value to a piece of data like it was a variable. In variable assignments, the variable name must always be on the left like:
	variable = "value"
