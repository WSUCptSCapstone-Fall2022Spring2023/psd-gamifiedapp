Life support confirms gases are now combining correctly.

Next priority, coolant. It appears that the coolant mixture isn't correct in parts of the ship. If I try and fire up other systems like this they might overheat.

There is a variable called 'coolant' in the system. It won't do anything to set it directly but I can set the system's 'liquid' then call 'MixCoolant()' to mix it.

For this to work 'liquid' will need to be equal to 11 times the coolant amount. In code I should be able to just set liquid equal to
	'11 * coolant'
using '*' as a multiplication sign. I can reveiw math symbols like this in the manual if I need to.

~After I've set the values, I'll need to call 'MixCoolant()' to make the mixture.

~Something appears to be wrong with my coolant mixture. Setting liquid to 11 times the coolant should look something like 
	'liquid = coolant * 11'

~I can't change coolant directly, but I can use it to set another variable like 'liquid'

~SyntaxError("unexpected token 'x'")
When I'm multiplying numbers in code, I need to use the asterisk (*) symbol, since code treats 'x' like a variable name.
