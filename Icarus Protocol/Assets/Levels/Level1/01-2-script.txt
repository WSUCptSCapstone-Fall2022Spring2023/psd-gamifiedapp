Perfect! The system is up and running. Now I can see what's wrong. Hmm first things first, nitrogen backfill seems to be broken.

To get this working, I'll need to set 'nitrogen' equal to 78, and 'oxygen' equal to 22. Then I'll need to activate the 'MixGases()' function.

To call a function I just write the function's name, followed by parentheses '()', and that will activate a piece of code somewhere else in the system.

~Hmmm... that didn't seem to work. I should only need one line of code I think... something like 'lifeSupportActive = True'
