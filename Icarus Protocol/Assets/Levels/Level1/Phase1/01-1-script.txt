Well I won't be able to fix anything else until the system is active. There is a 'variable' in the code that should let me turn it on. I think it was called... 'active'. 

A variable is like a special keyword made by me or already made in the code. The keyword can be used to store data for later use.

Variables can hold all sorts of data, but activating the life support means I'll need to set active equal to the special keyword True. 
I can set a variable by writing its name, followed by an '=' sign, then the value I want to set it to. 

~Hmmm... that didn't seem to work. I should only need one line of code I think... something like 
	active = True
I need to make sure not to put any type of quotes (''/"") around these keywords. Doing that makes them a different type of data called 'strings' instead.

~NameError("name 'true' is not defined") 
Make sure that when I set something to True, I use a capital 'T' in True. Keywords and variable names are case sensitive, so 'true' is not the same as 'True'

~SyntaxError("can't assign to literal")
The variable name active shouldn't be written with quotes around it when I'm using it in code, otherwise the code will see it as a different data type called a "string".
