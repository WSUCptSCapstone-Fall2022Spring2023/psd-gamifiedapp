Perfect! The system is up and running. Now I can see what's wrong. First things first, nitrogen backfill seems to be broken.

To get this working, I'll need to set the nitrogen and oxygen variables to the correct percentages, and then 'call' the MixGases() function to trigger system.

In the first two lines of this code I'll need to set oxygen = 22, and nitrogen = 78,
Then on the third line I'll need to write
	MixGases()
Which will trigger some code elsewhere in the system.

~It appears that the gas injectors didn't fire. After I have the mixture set correctly, I'll have to use the code 'MixGases()' to call the function.

~The gas injectors fired, but it looks like something was wrong with the mixture that I provided. Either my values were invalid, or they weren't the correct mix of 78 nitrogen to 22 oxygen.
