All systems are primed and ready, now to integrate life support with the rest of the ship. Once it's fully integrated there shouldn't be any more danger to the crew's cryopods.

I'll need to route power from the emergency reserves to integrate the system. I can do this using the 'RoutePower(amount)' function.

Along with executing code elsewhere in the program, functions can return data that I can use for other functions. If I call a function that 'returns' data I can store that data in variables or pass it in to other functions.

I can store the return value of 'GetPower()' in a variable like this:
	variable = GetPower()
Since I'm making this variable name myself I can call it anything I want. Then I should call 'RoutePower(amount)' using the variable as the amount.

~Something went wrong with routing the power. Once I've stored the value of 'GetPower()' in a variable with some name I need to call RoutePower(variableName) with the name I used.
