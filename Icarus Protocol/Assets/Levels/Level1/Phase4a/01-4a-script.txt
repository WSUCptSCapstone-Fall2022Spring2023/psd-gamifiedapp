Heating vent "HV-67" is totally stuck. I'll need to surge power to it to break it open.

To surge power I'll need to first isolate that vent by calling 
IsolateVent(ventName)
replacing 'ventName' with the target vent's name in quotes ("")

Then I'll need to call SurgePower(num) with num being any number between 73 and 76.

So putting the algorithm together; Call IsolateVent(ventName) on vent "HV-67", and then SurgePower(num) with a number between 73 and 76.

~Something went wrong. Most likely I'm not calling both of the functions correctly and in order.

~IsolateVent() threw an error. I must not be targeting the right vent. I need to remember to get the name exactly right with capitals and symbols, and surround it in quotes ("")

~When I simulated the code a breaker tripped. I must have surged the wrong amount of power to the system.

~I'm reading an error in the SurgePower function. I need to use a number with with no special characters or letters around it like
SurgePower(100)

~NameError("name 'HV' is not defined")
The vent name "HV-67" is a 'string' word, not a variable. That means it has to be passed into the function in quotes ("")
