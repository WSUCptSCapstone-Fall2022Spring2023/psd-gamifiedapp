Life support is almost functional. It looks like there's some leftover heat in the system that needs to be vented.

Some functions in the system require extra information. In order to provide these 'parameters' to functions you put the info in the parentheses separated by commas. 

I should be able to vent heat from the system by calling 'VentHeat(amount, time)' where amount is how many degrees to vent per second and time is the number of seconds.

The target temperature is 86 degrees, and the system is currently at 100 degrees. So I'll need to call 'VentHeat(amount, time)' with the right information to lower the temperature.

~I'll need to call VentHeat properly in order to do anything. For instance, to vent 1 degree a second for 5 seconds I'd program 'VentHeat(1, 5)'

~I tried to vent heat, but the system is still too hot. I either need to vent more heat each second or burn heat for longer.

~It looks like I vented too much heat. I should either vent fewer degrees each second or vent heat for less time.
