Life support is almost functional. It looks like there's some leftover heat in the system that needs to be vented.

Some functions in the system require extra information. In order to provide these 'parameters' to functions you put the info in the parentheses separated by commas. 

Parameters can be of any data type, but most functions expect certain types of data in a certain order.

I should be able to vent heat from the system by calling 'VentHeat(amount, time)' where amount is how many degrees to vent per second and time is the number of seconds.

The target temperature is 86 degrees, and the system is currently at 100 degrees. So I'll need to call 
'VentHeat(amount, time)' 
with the right information to lower the temperature by 14 degrees.

~I'll need to call VentHeat properly in order to do anything. For instance, to vent 1 degree a second for 5 seconds I'd program 'VentHeat(1, 5)'

~I tried to vent heat, but the system is still too hot. I either need to vent more heat each second or burn heat for longer.

~It looks like I vented too much heat. I should either vent fewer degrees each second or vent heat for less time.

~NameError("name is not defined")
Although the function description is written as 'VentHeat(amount, time)', when I actually call the function I need to replace 'amount' and 'time' with data. For instance,
'VentHeat(1,2)' 
would vent 1 heat per second for 2 seconds.

~TypeError('VentHeat() takes exactly two arguments')
When I call VentHeat(amount, time), I need to pass it both a numeric amount and a time. Giving it too much or too little information will cause the function to break.
