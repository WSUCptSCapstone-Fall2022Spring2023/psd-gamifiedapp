Power levels show the reactor core operating at near maximum power. Now I can turn my attention to some of the other important systems. Most essential is fixing navigation. 

Once we can figure out where we're going I can get the ship back on track for its mission.

First things first. I'll need to find the coordinates of the planet "Aletherial Prime" the data for planet coordinates is stored in a list called 'coords'. In the code, lists work like variables, but contain more than one value. 

I can get one of the values in the list using 'indexing'. If I have a list called 'myList' 'myList[0]' gets me the first item in the list (list indexes start with 0), 'myList[1]' will get the second item and so on.

The coords list contains the following:
coords = [Kalmephus, Nundiecarro, Rugnarth, Supheron, Rigantu, Onides, Aletharial Prime, Cenegawa, Siverus, Dao KGA, Zyke 6SZ] 

I need to assign the variable destination to equal "coords[index]" where index is the list index of Aletharial Prime

~The coordinates I provided seem to point at Cenegawa instead of Aletharial Prime, remember that list indexes begin at 0, meaning the 6th item is actually at index 5

~Hmm, those coordinates don't seem correct. Either they're point at the incorrect planet, or I forgot to store the coordinates in the destination variable entirely

~The simulation failed because I modified the coords list. I should only be using its data, not setting anything to it.
