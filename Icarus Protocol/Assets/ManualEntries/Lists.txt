A list is a container that can store many types of variables. The list is like a number line that starts at 0, and for each number you can add a variable in that slot. 

  -  myList = []
     myList.Append(1)
     myList.Append(2)
     myList.Append(4)

    # You can reference a specific slot with "[(slot number)]'
     print(myList[0]) # This will print 1
     print(myList[2]) # This will print 4
