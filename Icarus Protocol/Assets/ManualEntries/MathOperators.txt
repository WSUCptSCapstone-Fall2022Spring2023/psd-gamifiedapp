Many operators are the same as the ones used in math but with a different symbols. Generally, these operators are used on numbers but there are some that are used with other variable types.

Arithmetic:
  -  num = 1 + 2 # num is an int
     print(num) # prints 3
     num = num * 3 num is an int
     print(num) # prints 9
     num = num / 4.0 # num is a float
     print(num) # prints 2.5
     num = num + 0.5 * 3 # num is a float
     print(num) # prints 4.0

Modulo:
  -  # Modulo divides the numbers given and returns the remainder
     remainder = 11 % 3
     print(remainder) # prints 2

Power:
  -  # Power is how many times the number multiplies 
       by itself
     squared = 2 ** 2
     print(squared) # prints 4
     cubed = 2 ** 3
     print(cubed) # prints 8
