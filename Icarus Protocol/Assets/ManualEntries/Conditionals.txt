A conditional is a statement that when evaluated is either True or False. Some common conditionals are:

  -  x = 2

    # You can check if a variable is the same as 
      another variable with "=="
     print(x == 2) # prints True
     print(x == 3) # prints False

    # You can also check if a variable is not the 
      same as another variable with "!="
     print(x != 2) # prints False

    # You can use < (less than), > (greater than), 
      <= (less than or equal to), and >= (greater than or equal to)
     print(x < 3) # prints True

  - x = 5
    if x > 3:
        print("Mystery number is greater than 3")
    # This will print "Mystery number is greater than 3"
