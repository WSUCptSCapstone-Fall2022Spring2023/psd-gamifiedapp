Many operators are the same as the ones used in math but with a different symbols. Generally, these operators are used on numbers but there are some that are used with other variable types.

And:
  -  # The 'and' keyword checks if both statements to the left and right of it are both True, if they are it will return True, else False.
     print((x == 2) and (x < 5)) # prints True
     print((x == 2) and (x == 3)) # prints False

Or:
  -  # The 'or' keyword checks if at least one statement, either on the left or right of it, is True, if so then it returns True, else False;
     print((x == 2) or (x <5)) # prints True
     print((x == 2) or (x == 3)) # prints True
     print((x == 1) or (x == 3)) # prints False

Strings:
  -  helloWorld = "Hello" + " " + "World"
     print(helloWorld) # prints "Hello World"
     
     helloWorld = helloWorld * 2
     print(HelloWorld) # prints "Hello WorldHello World"

Lists:
  -  evens = [2, 4, 6]
     odds = [1, 3, 5]
     all = evens + odds
     print(all) # prints [2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5]
     
  -  print([1, 2, 3] * 2) # prints [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
