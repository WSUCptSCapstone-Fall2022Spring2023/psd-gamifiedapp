Using conditionals, you can use if statements to control the flow of the program. 

If:
  -  num = 2
     if num == 2:
        print("num was 2!")
        
    # This prints "num was 2!"

If-Else:
  -  num = 2
     if num > 2:
        print("num is greater than 2!")
     else:
        print("num is 2 or lower!")
        
    # This prints "num is 2 or lower!"

If-Elif-Else:
  -  num = 2
     if num > 2:
        print("num is greater than 2!")
     elif num < 2:
        print("num is less than 2!")
     elif num == 2:
        print("num is 2!")
     else:
        print("num isn't a number?")
        
    # This prints "num is 2!"
