A comment is a line or section of code that the computer knows not to read. They can be used to leave notes to yourself or others. Here are some common commenting examples:

  - # My secret comment
    # I can leave quite a few
    # of these comments
     
  - ''' 
    If I want to leave a longer comment that 
    is over one line, I can use three (') or (").
    '''
