# Sprint 5 Report (02/05/2023 - 3/02/2023)

Demo Video Link: https://youtu.be/Sy-JpYVcK-E

## What's New (User Facing)

There are two main new user facing changes: visual and audio. On the visual front, the art for level's three and four has been fully implemented. For audio, there were two categories that the team focused on, background music and sound effects. The background music features three tracks: epic intro track, lofi programming track, and boss programming track. The epic track is played in the beginning screen for the game. The lofi is the primary track, played in level select and during normal and challenge levels. The boss music is only played during the boss level in the level player. Additionally, there was content extension for both level three and four.

Aside from the issues dedicated to sprint 5, the team also created a playtest build that isolated completed levels and added logging functionality for data collection. 

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)

Similar to the previous sprint, the team split into two groups, one to tackle art creation and background music implementation and the other to work on art and sound effect implementation. The idea is that since art creation must occur before art implementation, while the group working on art creation is handling that issue, the other team can work on sound effect implementation. The afterwards, the groups would switch focus to their other designated issue for the sprint. 

## Unfinished Work

There was no unfinished work for this sprint.

 ## Incomplete Issues/User Stories

 There were no incomplete issues or user stories.

## Code Files for Review

Please review the following code files, which were actively developed during this sprint, for quality:

- AudioHandlerBehavior.cs: manages which track should be playing and how to switch tracks

*Temporary scripts and behaviors made only for UI testing and demo purposes are omitted for brevity, and since they'll be deleted once they are no longer useful*

## Retrospective Summary

Here's what went well:

  * Last sprint, we wanted to experiment with exporting the art assets not as a series of png files but potentially a photoshop or a zipped file. This sprint we have found a work-in-progress methodology that isolates files into folders for each phase, adding in clarity and ease when implementing the new diagrams for a phase.
  * The team did a good job continuing to work on the sprint, prioritizing work on it despite additional work from other classes during Midterm week.

Here's what we'd like to improve:

   * We would like to continue to improve our work balance for sprints, not having one really busy sprint that is followed by a sprint with little to do.
   * We also would like to continue to improve our workflow of importing art designs for levels.

Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:

   * In the future, the team will discuss and review the issues dedicated to future sprints..
   * In the future, the team will continue to experiment with exporting the art assets, perhaps through GitHub's mobile application.
