## What's New (User Facing)

The main focus of the sprint was the refinement of the content for level 5 and the boss level as well as the addition of a mini boss level preceding the boss level. Additionally, the art for each phase in level 5, mini boss, and boss level has been completed and implemented. 

Additionally, the team created a functional Playtest build with logging functionality. Near the middle of the sprint, the team met with Mr. Davis and some interested student and ran a play test of the current playtesting build. This build only includes finished levels (levels 1,2,3, and 4).

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)

Similar to the previous sprints, the team split into two groups, one to tackle art creation and the other to work on content extension. The idea is that since content extension must occur before art creation and art creation must occur before art implementation, the team would create a streamline process of content extension to art creation to art implementation. 

## Unfinished Work

If applicable, explain the work you did not finish in this sprint. For issues/user stories in the current sprint that have not been closed, (a) any progress toward completion of the issues has been clearly tracked (by checking the checkboxes of  acceptance criteria), (b) a comment has been added to the issue to explain why the issue could not be completed (e.g., "we ran out of time" or "we did not anticipate it would be so much work"), and (c) the issue is added to a subsequent sprint, so that it can be addressed later.

There was one issue that the team didn't complete this sprint: [#57 Automated Testing](https://github.com/WSUCptSCapstone-Fall2022Spring2023/psd-gamifiedapp/issues/57).

- Automated Testing
  - After an internal discussion with the team, given that our team was leaving on a trip which interfered with the end of the sprint, it was decided that we would focus primarily on the playtesting done with Lincoln Middle School as well as core content extensions rather than automated testing. The team intends to complete this issue in the next sprint.

## Completed Issues/User Stories

Here are links to the issues that we completed in this sprint:

 * [#47 Content Extension for Main Level 5 & Boss Level](https://github.com/WSUCptSCapstone-Fall2022Spring2023/psd-gamifiedapp/issues/47)
 * [#43 MVP Doc Revisions Draft 3](https://github.com/WSUCptSCapstone-Fall2022Spring2023/psd-gamifiedapp/issues/43)
 * [#51 Visuals for Main Level 5 & Boss Level](https://github.com/WSUCptSCapstone-Fall2022Spring2023/psd-gamifiedapp/issues/50)

 ## Incomplete Issues/User Stories

- [#57 Automated Unit Testing](https://github.com/WSUCptSCapstone-Fall2022Spring2023/psd-gamifiedapp/issues/57) <It was decided that this issue would be moved to the next sprint, given the smaller time frame for the team this sprint.>

## Code Files for Review

Please review the following code files, which were actively developed during this sprint, for quality:

- ListDisplayBehavior.cs: controls the behavior of displaying a list in a phase UI element

*Temporary scripts and behaviors made only for UI testing and demo purposes are omitted for brevity, and since they'll be deleted once they are no longer useful. Additionally, files that contain art assets have been omitted.* 

## Retrospective Summary

Here's what went well:

  * For the past few sprints, the team has been experimenting with methods to streamline the import of art assets from one team member to another. The team has found that exporting the files as a series of png files, then adding them to the correct places in an art import branch, then having the other team member merge that branch into his work is an efficient and streamlined method that works for this team.
  * The team did a good job continuing to work on the sprint, prioritizing work on it despite additional work from other classes in preparation for leaving for a week for the National Model United Nations conference.

Here's what we'd like to improve:

   * We would like to continue to improve our work balance for sprints, not having one really busy sprint that is followed by a sprint with little to do.

Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:

   * In the future, the team will discuss and review the issues dedicated to future sprints.
