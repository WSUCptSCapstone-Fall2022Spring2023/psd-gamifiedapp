## What's New (User Facing)

The main focus of the sprint was the refinement of the UI and content for the challenge levels, review and modification based on the results of the play test with Pullman School District, and the addition of a cut-scene system. 

The challenge levels have the diagrams created for the sole phase and their content has been refined to be more clear for the user.

There were several modifications to the script of the first few levels based on player feedback that we observed during the play testing session. 

The team also added a cut-scene system, where there are three main cut-scenes: Introduction, Mini-Boss, Post-Boss. The introduction cut-scene introduces the player to who they are in the game, Icarus, what has happened and what they will need to do. The Mini-Boss cut-scene introduces the villain Daedalus, whom the player will need to remove from the system. The Post-Boss cut-scene provides an outro to the game post the defeat of Daedalus. 

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)

Similar to the previous sprints, the team split into two groups, one to tackle art creation and the other to work on content extension and modification. The idea is that since content extension must occur before art creation and art creation must occur before art implementation, the team would create a streamline process of content extension to art creation to art implementation. This philosophy extends to cut-scene creation and implementation.

## Code Files for Review

Please review the following code files, which were actively developed during this sprint, for quality:

- ListDisplayBehavior.cs: controls the behavior of displaying a list in a phase UI element

*Temporary scripts and behaviors made only for UI testing and demo purposes are omitted for brevity, and since they'll be deleted once they are no longer useful. Additionally, files that contain art assets have been omitted.* 

## Retrospective Summary

Here's what went well:

  * The team did a great job addressing concerns and issues raised during the play testing session and incorporating the results into the game to enhance the player experience. 
  * The team did a good job continuing to work on the sprint, prioritizing work on it despite additional work from other classes in preparation for finals in other classes and class presentation.
  * Additionally, the team did a good job meeting the expectations set by the stakeholders for each semester that the team has been working on the Icarus Protocol.

While the team believe there is always room for improvement, they have decided to omit the following sections due to this being the final sprint report.
